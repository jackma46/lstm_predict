# Getting Data
This program requires acccess to MIMIC-III Clinical Database through Physionet: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/
Access to this database requires express approval, please follow the instructions.

Once access is granted, download ADMISSIONS, DIAGNOSES_ICD, PROCEDURES_ICD, PRESCRIPTIONS, LABEVENTS, PATIENTS, AND PROCEDUREEVENTS_MV files.
Save these files in csv format to "minicIII" folder in the working directory.
